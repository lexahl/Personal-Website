I was inspired to switch to a low-impact, static-HTML website after [Organic Basics](https://lowimpact.organicbasics.com/usd), an underwear brand that sells eco-friendly tencel products, announced their release of a new Low-Impact Website option, which does not include videos and has very limited imagery. I know this is a really little change, and my site does not get many hits at all, but why not? Why haven't you done this too?

- [the internet (data centres, power plants, devices, transmission networks, etc) is responsible for about the same amount of carbon emissions as aviation (3%)](https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20200305-why-your-internet-habits-are-not-as-clean-as-you-think#:~:text=If%20we%20were%20to%20rather,of%20carbon%20dioxide%20a%20year)

- [an average website produces 1.76 grams CO2 per view](https://www.websitecarbon.com/) 

- in 2016 it took [70 billion kilowatt hours a year to run the internet](https://www.forbes.com/sites/christopherhelman/2016/06/28/how-much-electricity-does-it-take-to-run-the-internet/#3ab4384c1fff), to generate that energy, you’d need to run power plants with a baseload capacity of 8,000 megawatts — equivalent to about 8 big nuclear reactors." 

- [by processing around 3.5 billion searches a day, google accounts for about 40% of the internet’s carbon footprint, an estimated amount of 500 kg of CO2 emissions per second.](https://qz.com/1267709/every-google-search-results-in-co2-emissions-this-real-time-dataviz-shows-how-much/)

To create a low-impact website, I chose to create a static [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) site (static HTML), use [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) for hosting, and I followed some guidelines on [building low impact websites](https://gomakethings.com/building-low-impact-websites/). This Hugo layout is designed by [VarKai](https://varkai.com/), is really easy to modify/manage, and most importantly, is really low impact. To support my projects and showcase my work, but to be conscious of the impact of them, I will try to limit the use of images and graphics. If you would like to see a demo please send me an [email](mailto:lexi.ahluwalia@gmail.com).
