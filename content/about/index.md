My name is Alexandria Ahluwalia and I recently completed my undergrad in at UBC (B.Sc Mathematics, German). Currently I am collaborating with the multidisciplinary Collective for Gender+ in Research to develop accessible and intersectional guides to help organizations incorporate data justice principles in community-based data projects. In this project we are working to determine and challenge systemic barriers that are present in research narratives and data collection, including issues around inaccessibility and unaccountability.

I love traveling, learning languages, making jewelry, and working (critically) with data. My past and current projects can be found [here](/projects), and I can be best reached by [email](mailto:lexahl@protonmail.com).
