My name is Alexandria Ahluwalia and I am in my 6th year as an undergraduate Mathematics and German student, currently finishing my degree online at [UBC](https://www.ubc.ca/). I love traveling, learning languages, making jewelry, and working with data. My past and current projects can be found [here](/projects), and I can be best reached by [email](mailto:lexi.ahluwalia@gmail.com).
