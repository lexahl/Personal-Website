In a Relational Database course at UBC, we created, as a group, a basic relational database to demonstrate our understanding of relational database systems, logical database design, E-R models, formal relational query languages, SQL, functional dependencies, and normalization. Our project was done using UBC's Computer Science department's Oracle database system and PHP. For our team project we created a database "CruiseControl" which provides the employees and management a system to keep track of data from each employee and all the associated data to support the well-being of the employees. The idea of having an on-board database would help keep costs down on a cruise ship and would support employees by providing them access to their information without the need for an expensive internet connection. 

Functionalities of the database include insertion operations demonstrated by the ability to send messages to other employees on the ship, to post announcements, to create internal events. The delete operation is demonstrated by the ability to delete messages by supplying message IDs. An update operation shown in the entertainment system, where a user can see all a specific media type by specifying the type: Movie, TV Show, or Short Video. Another update operation is shown by the ability for employees to modify their shift duration if they feel sick. A projection operation is shown with the view of specific fields of all media files in the system by clicking on checkboxes.
