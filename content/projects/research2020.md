In the spring term of 2020 at UBC I had the opportunity to take a course that provided an opportunity to explore a Mathematics topic to depth. My group and I chose to research and write a comprehensive yet understandable, at an Undergraduate Mathematics level, paper on the Gaussian Integers. Names have been removed for privacy reasons.



# The Arithmetic of the Gaussian Integers

# Abstract:
Carl Friedrich Gauss (1777-1855) was a German number theorist who influenced many diverse fields of mathematics. The investigations described in this paper were first addressed in his 1832 monograph Theoria Residuorum Biquadraticorum, in which Gauss laid the foundation for much of modern number theory. One of his innumerable contributions to the field was the discovery of the Gaussian Integers, which he defined and proved various results about. The properties of this particular subset of the complex numbers is the topic of this paper. The Gaussian integers are the complex numbers of the form $a + bi$ where $a$ and $b$ are integers. The set of all such numbers is denoted $Z[i]$. One can add and multiply Gaussian integers as one would with any complex numbers. This definition suggests that the Gaussian integers have analogous arithmetic properties to the integers. Indeed, this paper will show that the Gaussian integers can be used to investigate the properties of the integers, and simplify various problems in number theory by translating them
into the setting of the Gaussian integers. In this paper, we develop the theory of the Gaussian integers, we then apply our results to give a novel proof of Fermatâ€™s theorem on the sum of two squares. The reader observes the similarities between arithmetic in $Z$ and $Z[i]$, while at the same time, notices the simplifying tactic of reframing problems in terms of the Gaussian integers.
