Currently in the planning phase of a project to find better practices in (fillable) forms. From the voluntary self-identification on job application to the census, data is being collected in a harmful way. This project stems from the goal to not continue with extractive and harmful research practices in the past, to support a more inclusive world, and ensure data justice principles.
