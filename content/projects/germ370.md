In a bilingual (English and German) course on 18th century German Literature at UBC, we studied texts with focus on Reason, Revolution, Race and Gender. The literature studied in the course includes *Die Braut von Korinth* by Goethe, *Die Nonne* by Brachmann, *Die Juden* and *Nathan der Weise* by Gotthold Ephraim Lessing, *Die zwey Emilien* by Charlotte von Stein, and *Der Verbrecher aus Verlorener Ehre* by Friedrich Schiller. Supplementary texts studied includes *Was ist Aufklärung* by Immanuel Kant, *Discipline and Punish* by Michel Foucault, *Die imaginierte Weiblichkeit* by Silvia Bovenschen, *Antigone’s Claim, and Kinship Between Life and Death* by Judith Butler​. 

For the final paper, I discuss the oppression of women by males in guardianship roles in German, referring to the adaptation into dramatic form of the British novel, *The Two Emilys, 1800* by Sophia Lee, *Die zwey Emilien, 1803* by Charlotte von Stein. Charlotte von Stein had been married to the more famous writer Friedrich Schiller. I also refer to the famous drama *Die Juden​* by Gotthold Ephraim Lessing.
