# DSCI100: Vino Verde Quality Data Set Report, Group Project by Alexandria Ahluwalia, Daniel Alimohd

What makes a good wine? What separates an okay glass of wine from a great glass of wine? Many will answer these questions with a certain growing region, winery, or grape variety. But we would like to take this analysis further and find out what the top chemical factors are responsible for differentiating the quality of wine. We perform our analysis by using the Wine Quality Data Set from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.
