In the spring of 2019 I took an awesome introduction to data science course using R at UBC. This is one of the projects I was a part of. The instructors of the course put together an open source textbook with the materials and topics we went over in class. I highly recommend it for anyone wanting to start with data science. The link to the open-source textbook is [here](https://ubc-dsci.github.io/introduction-to-datascience/index.html).

# DSCI100: Vino Verde Quality Data Set Report, Group Project by Alexandria Ahluwalia, Daniel 

What makes a good wine? What separates an okay glass of wine from a great glass of wine? Many will answer these questions with a certain growing region, winery, or grape variety. But we would like to take this analysis further and find out what the top chemical factors are responsible for differentiating the quality of wine. We perform our analysis by using the Wine Quality Data Set from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.
