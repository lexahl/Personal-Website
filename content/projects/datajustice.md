Collaborating (Sept 2020 - Sept 2021) with the Gender+ Collective at ORICE UBC to develop a tangible, well-designed community guide for data justice in community-based projects by using relevant knowledge translation and user-centered design frameworks.

The Collective for Gender+ in Research works to promote a community for rich dialogue in which gender and other identity intersections, including race, class, sexuality and ability, are considered when conducting community-engaged research.

The Collective focuses on capacity building and providing the tools researchers need to utilize a gender+ lens.

Our Collective seeks to develop a network that works to articulate methods and tools to consider gendered dynamics inherent to working and researching in community.

These considerations bring together theoretical and practical considerations towards gathering knowledge that promotes gender justice.
