In the fall of 2019 I went on an academic exchange to Tecnológico de Monterrey to support the research of the optimization of 5G MIMO hybrid beamforming precoding algorithms. The research was lead by César Vargas-Rosales, <I>Tecnológico de Monterrey, School of Engineering and Sciences</I>, and supported by myself, Alexandria K. Ahluwalia - <I>University of British Columbia</I>, Gerardo Melendez Cocoletzi - <I>Tecnológico de Monterrey, School of Engineering and Sciences</I>, and Diego Fernando Carrera - <I>Tecnológico de Monterrey, School of Engineering and Sciences</I>. We submitted the article, titled "Comparison of Hybrid Beamforming Precoding Algorithms using Millimeter Waves" to the 6th International Electronic Conference on Sensors and Applications on the 22nd of October, 2019.


# Comparison of Hybrid Beamforming Precoding Algorithms using Millimeter Waves

# Abstract:
This study proposes and compares behaviours of different precoding and combining algorithms for beamforming in a 5G millimeter wave (mmWave) scenario to see how the algorithms perform when the channel conditions change randomly. First, a fixed scenario is generated where the devices deployed sense the channel and aid the transmitter in the estimation of the channel coefficients. We then obtain the digital beamforming matrices using optimization, and use this as the optimal algorithm. The second and third methods compared are generated using the same physical setup, but different algorithms to obtain the precoding and combining matrices to hybrid beamform to be able to compensate for the channel gains and phase changes. The second algorithm is the orthogonal matching pursuit and the third algorithm is our proposed method, a singular value selection method. We then compare the calculated spectral efficiencies (SEs) from each of the three different precoding and combining algorithms. Their performances are indicated and compared by using the SE as a function of the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) with different amounts of data streams.
