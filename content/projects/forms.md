### has an online form ever made you identify yourself as someone you are not?

First of all - data collection is often extractive and violent. Marginalized groups have been over-researched, and their data and knowledge have been stolen for centuries. Data collection is taking a new form in big-tech. Our data is being extracted, colonized, and appropriated for capitalism and is used to track, predict and racialize marginalized members of society). In this project, I want to center anti-racist and decolonial methods and indigenous ways of knowing. I am constantly unlearning and learning and appreciate the support and corrections when I am wrong ([but be nice](maiilto:lexahl@protonmail.com)).

I grew up in Canada in Moh'kinsstis (Calgary) and the traditional Treaty 7 territory. My parents' families came from different countries and backgrounds, so I am what the kids would call "mixed". When applying for jobs or filling out almost any form digitally (or rarely on paper) that asks for my race/ethnicity, I need to select something along the lines of "other," "two or more races," or a combination of those options (see above). I'm working on a project to educate and advocate for more inclusive and more accessible forms. We *all*  use the internet, and we are all not white, cisgender, and straight John and Jane Doe's. Not being able to identify myself the way I want to takes away from who I am. Further examples include when forms that ask for sex information and then give the options "Woman" and "Man" (yes, I saw this, [NYU Journalism](https://journalism.nyu.edu/)).


From the voluntary self-identification on job applications to the government census questions, our data is still collected in a harmful way. This project stems from the goal to not continue with extractive and harmful practices, to support a more inclusive world, and ensure accessibility.

I still have a lot of reading to do, a lot of writing to do, and many examples to gather. I would appreciate all the support I can get!

Yu is the pinyin romanization of several Chinese family names such as 余, 于, 由, 魚 (鱼), and 漁(渔). Li (李) is the second most common surname in China, shared by more than 100 million worldwide.

While this may seem like a solution, there are many other truths about names to consider. To know the truths, unlearning through questioning our beliefs may help. Some myths that are common about names:

* People have exactly one full name, which they go by.
* People's names do not change
* People's names are written in ASCII.
* People's names are case sensitive.
* You can safely assume that a dictionary of bad words contains no people's names in it
* People have names
* People's names are case insensitive.
* People's names sometimes have prefixes or suffixes, but you can safely ignore those.
* People's names do not contain numbers.
* People's names are not written in ALL CAPS.
* People's names are not written in all lower case letters

The western practice of combining a given name (first name) with a family name (last name) is not universal. Some people do not use or have last names. A mononymous person is an individual known and addressed by a single name (a mononym). Some ethnic groups in Indonesia do not use family names (surnames, last names). Some other ethnic groups and individuals also do not have last names. Most Icelanders do not have surnames but rather patronymics or matronymics.
